* Subclass all ambient, diffuse and so on Phong params into a
  "fx_common_color_or_texture_type" as per the Collada spec.
  Allow for both a color and texture option (back linking textcoords a
  hassle?).

* Rewrite the Collada loader, to load everything in order?
  (But in pratice Images come after effects for some reason?).

* Store all id's / sid's in the Collada type to allow for path setting.
  (Requires the loader to pass the origional Collada object around.)

* Consider making the XML engine pluggable like rendering engine?

* Maybe replace QT editor windows with an inbuilt HTTP server and webkit
  rendered windows?

* Collada version differences.
  In Collada 1.4.1 a <texture> will link to a <sampler2D> which will
  link to a <surface type="2D"> which will then <init_from> an <image>.
  In Collada 1.5 <texture> links directly to a <sampler2D> that
  <instance_image>'s an <image>.

* QT Widgets draw in reversed order, window on top is window behind o_O
