cppcollada is a program for rendering COLLADA dae files.

Currently only basic features are supported and there is no optimization. Simple triangle based meshes with textures work.

Building
========

cppcollada uses the scons build system
apt-get install scons

To make:
scons

To install:
scons install

To compile debug version:
scons debug=1

To compile using llvm:
scons clang=1 boost=1

The folowing libraries are used:
cmake
libglew1.5-dev - OpenGL extentions.
glm - For OpenGL Matrix functions.
libdevil-dev - For texture loading.
libxerces-c-dev - XML parsing.
libqt4-dev - For the QT interface.
libqt4-opengl-dev
libnoise-dev - Use for an experiment using noise for random level generation.
libsdl1.2-dev

To install them in Ubuntu (except for GLM which much be done manually):
sudo apt-get install cmake libglew1.5-dev libdevil-dev libxerces-c-dev libqt4-dev libqt4-opengl-dev libnoise-dev libsdl1.2-dev
